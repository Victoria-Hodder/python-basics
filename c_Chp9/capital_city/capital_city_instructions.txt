Challenge: Capital City Loop

First, fill out the following dictionary with the remaining states and
their associated capitals in a file called capitals.py :

capitals_dict = {
    'Alabama': 'Montgomery',
    'Alaska': 'Juneau',
    'Arizona': 'Phoenix',
    'Arkansas': 'Little Rock',
    'California': 'Sacramento',
    'Colorado': 'Denver',
    'Connecticut': 'Hartford',
    'Delaware': 'Dover',
    'Florida': 'Tallahassee',
    'Georgia': 'Atlanta'
}

Next, pick a random state name from the dictionary and assign both
the state and its capital to two variables. You’ll need to import the
random module at the top of your program.

Then display the name of the state to the user and ask them to enter
the capital. If the user answers incorrectly, then repeatedly ask them
for the capital until they either enter the correct answer or type "exit" .

If the user answers correctly, then display "Correct" and end the pro-
gram. However, if the user exits without guessing correctly, display
the correct answer and the word "Goodbye" .

Note
Make sure the user isn’t punished for case sensitivity. In other
words, a guess of "Denver" is the same as "denver" . Do the same
for exiting— "EXIT" and "Exit" should work the same as "exit" .
