"""
Write a program that asks the user to input a string and an integer
(n), then displays the character at index n in the string.
Use error handling to make sure the program doesnâ€™t crash
if the user enters something other than an integer or if the index
is out of bounds. The program should display a different message
depending on which error occurs.
